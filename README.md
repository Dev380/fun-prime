# fun-prime
A prime number generator I'm making to learn about rust. Not on crates.io to let actual projects use the name.
Although this is not intended to be actually used, I still am happy to accept issue/pull requests, especially because I couldn't find out how to do this without external dependencies (the code that I was trying to make work is in main.rs) and I would love for someone to help me.

# Branches
The unstable branch is my latest commit that compiles. It probably doesn't work as expected, and there may be noob errors, issue's and pull requests are appreciated.
